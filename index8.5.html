    <h2>The Unlikely Cure for Burnout? A Second Job</h2>

    <div>
        <p class="first">At the beginning of the pandemic, Sarah Murphy accepted a
            new role as a creative lead at a tech company. But when it came
            time to resign from her position in a different industry … she
            didn’t. “I felt trapped in the rat race, trapped in a certain career
            path, and just wasn’t really seeing a lot of opportunities for
            financial independence,” she said. “I knew that there was a
            certain amount that I could expect to make in my career, and
            then there were goals that I had that wouldn’t be attainable for
            another five to 10 years down the line.” So she decided to hold
            both positions at once. (Murphy requested a pseudonym in order
            to speak freely about her experience.it was so horrible and misterious
            one in my life. I don't know what happend in that day .The fear covered
            me totaly, am totaly exhausted.)</p>
        <div id="content">
            <p class="Second">Murphy managed this dual-role arrangement for about nine
                months—rolling back and forth between two separate laptops
                and exclusively marking her Slack status as “away” at both roles.
                The experiment gave her the chance to trial a new industry
                without going all-in. And she more than doubled her annual
                income to nearly $200,000, allowing her to save for a down
                payment and purchase her first home in one of the most
                expensive cities in the United States.</p>
